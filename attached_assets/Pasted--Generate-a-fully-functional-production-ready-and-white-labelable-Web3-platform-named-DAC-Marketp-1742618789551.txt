"Generate a fully functional, production-ready, and white-labelable Web3 platform named 'DAC Marketplace' within a Replit environment. This platform should be designed for immediate deployment and seamless integration into any existing or future business system. The platform must adhere to the following specifications:

**Core Functionality:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Structure:**
    * Implement a robust DAO governance system using smart contracts on a Layer-2 blockchain (Polygon or Arbitrum preferred) for scalability.
    * Create a native governance token (DAC) with clear tokenomics, including distribution, allocation, and utility.
    * Develop a user-friendly interface for voting, proposal submission, and treasury management.
    * Implement a system to allow the DAO to update the smart contracts, and platform rules.
2.  **AI-Driven Real Estate Transaction Platform:**
    * Develop a global property listing platform with advanced search and filtering capabilities.
    * Integrate AI-powered tools for creative finance strategies (subject-to, seller financing, lease options).
    * Automate the generation of legally compliant smart contracts, tailored to specific jurisdictions, using AI legal agents.
    * Integrate decentralized escrow and title services.
3.  **AI and Data Analytics:**
    * Implement AI-powered property valuation tools with real-time data feeds and market analysis.
    * Develop an AI legal agent network for global compliance checks and legal risk assessment.
    * Create AI prompt generators for property listing descriptions.
4.  **Gig Economy Integration:**
    * Establish a task marketplace for real estate-related gig opportunities (lead generation, photography, data entry, etc.).
    * Implement skill-based matching using AI to connect users with relevant tasks.
    * Develop a robust reputation and rating system for users.
5.  **Community and Membership Management:**
    * Create a multi-tiered membership system (free-mium with sweat equity, Basic, Premium, Enterprise).
    * Develop a sweat equity program with a task marketplace and points/credits system.
    * Implement forums, chat rooms, and educational resources for community engagement.
    * Implement a system that allows DAO token holders to have special access, and voting rights.
6.  **Global Currency and Payment System:**
    * Integrate with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and stablecoins for seamless global currency conversion.
    * Implement a secure payment gateway supporting both cryptocurrency and fiat transactions.
    * Allow the user to set their preferred currency for all transactions.
7.  **White-Labeling and Integration:**
    * Design the platform with a modular architecture for easy customization and white-labeling.
    * Provide clear API documentation for seamless integration with other platforms and systems.
    * The platform must be built to be able to be deployed to any web server, and must be able to be integrated into any existing website.
8.  **Security and Compliance:**
    * Implement robust security measures, including encryption, access controls, and regular security audits.
    * Ensure compliance with global real estate and blockchain regulations, utilizing the AI legal agent network.
    * Implement KYC/AML procedures.
9.  **User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX):**
    * Develop an intuitive and user-friendly UI/UX for all platform features.
    * Ensure cross-platform compatibility and accessibility.
    * Multilingual Support.
10. **Technical Specifications:**
    * Use React for the front-end, Solidity for smart contracts, and Web3.js for blockchain integration.
    * Utilize IPFS or Arweave for decentralized data storage.
    * Implement Decentralized Identity (DID) solutions for user authentication.
    * The platform must be built with a microservice architecture.
11. **Documentation:**
    * Generate comprehensive documentation for all platform features, APIs, and smart contracts.

**Output Requirements:**

* A fully functional Replit project containing all source code, smart contracts, and configuration files.
* Clear and concise documentation for all platform features and integration instructions.
* A demonstration of the platform's core functionalities.
* A guide on how to deploy this platform to a live server.

**Intention:**

This platform will serve as the foundational architecture for all future business ventures, enabling decentralized governance, equitable commerce, and seamless integration into any system. Ensure the platform is stable, secure, and easily adaptable for various applications."
