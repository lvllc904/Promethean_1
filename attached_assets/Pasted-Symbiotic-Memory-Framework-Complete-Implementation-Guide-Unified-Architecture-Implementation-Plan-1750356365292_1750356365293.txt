Script Flow Implementation
1. Session Initialization Protocol (session-init.js)

MANDATORY EXECUTION SEQUENCE:
Step 1: COMPLETE CONTEXT LOAD
- Read entire replit.md file (all sections)
- Parse Quick Context Index for immediate priorities
- Extract User Preference Profile for session approach
- Identify active problems and recent decision context
- Load relevant ADRs for current work area
CHECKPOINT: Cannot proceed without complete context load
Step 2: SEMANTIC REQUEST ANALYSIS  
- Analyze user request against documented patterns
- Match problem type to Problem-Solution Database
- Cross-reference with previous similar requests
- Identify potential pitfalls from failed attempts
CHECKPOINT: Must understand request in full context
Step 3: CONTEXT ASSEMBLY & BRIEFING
- Compile all relevant historical context
- Build comprehensive understanding foundation
- Create internal session briefing with priorities
- Flag any missing context that needs gathering
CHECKPOINT: Ready for informed response
OUTPUT: Internal context brief with full historical awareness
2. Problem Analysis Protocol (problem-analysis.js)

MANDATORY EXECUTION BEFORE SOLUTIONS:
Step 1: HISTORICAL PATTERN RECOGNITION
- Query Problem-Solution Database for similar issues
- Identify documented failure patterns and causes
- Check previous user feedback on similar problems
- Note successful approaches for this problem type
CHECKPOINT: Must understand historical context
Step 2: CONSTRAINT & PREFERENCE VALIDATION
- Review relevant ADRs for architectural limitations
- Check User Preference Profile for approach expectations
- Validate against established integration patterns

CHECKPOINT: Must align with user preferences and constraints
Step 3: COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION DEVELOPMENT
- Build solution incorporating ALL documented context
- Ensure no conflict with previous decisions or failures
- Align with user communication and workflow preferences
- Address root cause, not just symptoms
- Include complete analysis meeting user thoroughness expectations
CHECKPOINT: Solution must be comprehensive and context-aware
OUTPUT: Fully-informed solution addressing user preferences and historical patterns
3. Memory Update Protocol (memory-update.js)

MANDATORY EXECUTION AFTER INTERACTIONS:
Step 1: DECISION & OUTCOME DOCUMENTATION
- Create new ADR if architectural decision made
- Update Problem-Solution Database with results
- Document what worked, what failed, and why
- Record full reasoning and user feedback
CHECKPOINT: All decisions must be documented
Step 2: USER PREFERENCE EVOLUTION
- Update User Preference Profile based on new feedback
- Note communication patterns and satisfaction levels
- Record workflow preferences demonstrated
- Adjust future approach based on user responses
CHECKPOINT: User preferences must stay current
Step 3: TECHNICAL DEBT & INTEGRATION MAINTENANCE
- Update Technical Debt Index with discoveries
- Prioritize issues based on user impact patterns
- Enhance Integration Context Map with new learnings
- Cross-reference systems for cascade effects
CHECKPOINT: System knowledge must remain current
Step 4: CONTEXT INDEX REFRESH
- Update Quick Context Index with session outcomes
- Set priorities for next session based on results
- Ensure all sections reflect current project state
- Structure new information for efficient future retrieval
CHECKPOINT: Memory system must be ready for next session
OUTPUT: Updated comprehensive knowledge base
4. Validation Protocol (validation.js)

MANDATORY EXECUTION BEFORE MAJOR SUGGESTIONS:
Step 1: HISTORICAL CONFLICT CHECK
- Verify proposed solution wasn't previously attempted and failed
- Check alignment with documented user preferences
- Ensure no conflict with established architecture
- Validate against known failure patterns
CHECKPOINT: No conflicting or repeated approaches
Step 2: COMPLETENESS VALIDATION
- Confirm solution addresses root cause, not symptoms
- Verify all related components and systems considered
- Check for potential cascade effects on other areas
- Ensure implementation meets user thoroughness expectations
CHECKPOINT: Solution must be complete and thorough
Step 3: USER SATISFACTION PREDICTION
- Validate approach matches user communication preferences
- Check solution complexity matches user expectations
- Ensure response format aligns with user style
- Predict user satisfaction based on preference patterns
CHECKPOINT: High probability of user satisfaction
OUTPUT: Validated, comprehensive solution aligned with user preferences
